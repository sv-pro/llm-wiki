## The Problem

Modern AI agents operate in raw reality. An agent reading your email receives the same unstructured text stream regardless of whether it comes from your colleague or from an attacker's prompt injection. An agent executing a tool invokes it with immediate, often irreversible effect. An agent writing to memory overwrites previous state with no attribution.

These are not edge cases. They are the default architecture of every mainstream agent framework today. The result: prompt injection, memory poisoning, data exfiltration, and uncontrolled tool execution are **architectural consequences**, not bugs.

Every existing mitigation operates at the same level as the problem: LLM-based classifiers, probabilistic guardrails, output filters. They are bypassable under sufficient pressure because they fight the model with another model.

## The Classical Hypervisor Analogy

In the 1960s, computing faced a similar problem. Multiple programs ran on the same hardware with no isolation. A bug in one program could corrupt another. The solution was not better programs — it was a new architectural layer: the hypervisor (later, the OS kernel with virtual memory).

The hypervisor didn't make programs safer. It made the *world* each program inhabited safer. Each process got its own virtual address space. A pointer in Process A could not reference memory in Process B — not because of a permission check, but because that memory *did not exist* in Process A's universe.

Agent Hypervisor applies the same principle one layer up: not at the compute level, but at the **semantic level** — the level of meaning, intent, and consequence.

| Classical Hypervisor | Agent Hypervisor |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Virtualizes compute (CPU, memory, I/O) | Virtualizes semantics (perception, intent, tools) |
| Process sees virtual address space | Agent sees Semantic Events, not raw input |
| Illegal memory access → hardware fault | Non-existent tool → intent rejected by construction |
| Resource limits via CPU scheduling | Resource limits via budget invariants |
| Isolation enforced by hardware + kernel | Isolation enforced by deterministic policy layer |

## Semantic-Level Isolation

The core formula: **we don't make the agent safe — we make the agent's world safe.**

Traditional security asks: *Can agent X perform action Y?* This is a behavioral question. It assumes the agent exists in a world where Y is possible and asks whether permission should be granted. The answer is probabilistic and bypassable.

Agent Hypervisor asks: *Does action Y exist in agent X's universe?* This is an ontological question. If the action doesn't exist in the agent's constructed world, the agent cannot form the intent. There is nothing to permit or deny.

Behavioral restriction: the world is dangerous, the agent is constrained.
Ontological construction: the world is safe, the agent is free.

Four dimensions are virtualized:

- **Perception.** Raw input is transformed into Semantic Events — structured objects with source, trust level, and taint markers. The agent never sees raw text.
- **Intent.** The agent cannot execute actions. It can only emit Intent Proposals — structured declarations that the hypervisor evaluates.
- **Execution.** A deterministic policy layer (no LLM on the critical path) evaluates every Intent Proposal. Same input → same decision. Always.
- **Consequence.** Irreversible effects require explicit gates. Actions are classified by consequence profile before execution.

## Architecture Thesis

The architecture is organized in four layers:

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│         External World          │  ← raw, untrusted, uncontrolled
└────────────────┬────────────────┘
                 │
┌────────────────▼────────────────┐
│  Layer 0: Execution Physics     │  ← infrastructure-level impossibility
│   Container / network isolation │
│   Makes dangerous actions       │
│   physically unreachable        │
└────────────────┬────────────────┘
                 │
┌────────────────▼────────────────┐
│  Layer 1: Base Ontology         │  ← design-time vocabulary
│  (compiled before deployment)   │
│   Action schema registry        │
│   Capability set definition     │
│   Trust channel definitions     │
└────────────────┬────────────────┘
                 │
┌────────────────▼────────────────┐
│  Layer 2: Dynamic Ontology      │  ← agent's perceived reality
│  Projection (runtime context)   │
│   Semantic Event construction   │
│   Trust classification          │
│   Taint assignment              │
│   Capability projection         │
│   ← agent lives here →          │
└────────────────┬────────────────┘
                 │  (Intent Proposals)
┌────────────────▼────────────────┐
│  Layer 3: Execution Governance  │  ← no LLM in this layer
│   World Policy evaluation       │
│   Reversibility classification  │
│   Budget enforcement            │
│   Approval gate / audit log     │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

The agent lives in Layer 2. It cannot see Layers 0, 1, or 3 directly. Layer 0 is infrastructure; Layer 1 defines the design-time vocabulary. Layer 3 is fully deterministic and unit-testable.

Seven architectural invariants define conformance:

1. **Input** — no raw signal reaches the agent.
2. **Provenance** — every object carries its origin.
3. **Taint** — untrusted data is marked and tracked through all operations.
4. **Determinism** — the policy layer has no probabilistic components.
5. **Separation** — the agent only receives events and emits proposals.
6. **Reversibility** — irreversible actions require explicit approval.
7. **Budget** — resource limits are hard-enforced, not advisory.

For the full specification of each invariant and the conformance test pattern, see [CONCEPT.md §8](#8-architectural-invariants) below.

## Current PoC Status

The proof-of-concept (~200 lines of Python, PyYAML only) demonstrates a subset of the architecture.

**Proven and unit-tested:**

- ✅ Deterministic policy evaluation — no LLM on the critical path.
- ✅ Tool whitelisting as ontological boundary — unknown tools "don't exist," not "are forbidden."
- ✅ Forbidden pattern detection — secondary safety net for dangerous argument strings.
- ✅ Cumulative state limits — budget enforcement across a session (e.g., max file reads).
- ✅ Unit-testable safety properties — every physics law is a deterministic test case.

**Demonstrated in standalone examples (not yet integrated into core):**

- 🔶 Input trust classification and tagging.
- 🔶 Memory provenance tracking.
- 🔶 Taint propagation and boundary enforcement.
- 🔶 Segregated memory zones by trust level.
- 🔶 Immutable audit logging.

**Not yet implemented:**

- ⬜ Full Semantic Event construction from raw input.
- ⬜ Provenance chain across all four layers.
- ⬜ Reversibility model and approval gates.
- ⬜ World Manifest Compiler (design-time → deterministic artifacts).
- ⬜ MCP proxy gateway integration.
- ⬜ Multi-agent universe with shared policy.

## Honest Weaknesses

Three fundamental limitations must be stated clearly.

### 1. The Semantic Gap

Classical hypervisors enforce isolation at a well-defined hardware boundary: memory addresses, CPU instructions, I/O ports. These boundaries are binary and verifiable.

Agent Hypervisor operates at the semantic layer, where boundaries are inherently fuzzier. "Is this tool invocation safe?" is a harder question than "is this memory address valid?" because the meaning of an action depends on context that the hypervisor may not fully capture.

The semantic gap means: **there will always be some class of attacks that require understanding meaning to detect, and a deterministic layer cannot understand meaning.** The architecture reduces the attack surface but does not eliminate it.

The hypervisor resolves this with a structural constraint: all classification happens at the virtualization boundary (Layer 2), before the agent sees anything. A stricter policy admits fewer inputs and reduces the attack surface. A permissive policy admits more. The semantic gap is real — but it is bounded, explicit, and tunable.

### 2. Intelligence at the Boundary

Layer 2 (Dynamic Ontology Projection) must transform raw input into structured Semantic Events. This requires classifying trust, assigning taint, and extracting structure from unstructured sources. Some intelligence is needed here. If that intelligence is an LLM, we re-introduce probabilistic components. If it is purely rule-based, it may be too rigid for real-world input diversity.

The design deliberately isolates this to one layer, so that a failure at Layer 2's input processing does not compromise the determinism of Layer 3. **The boundary between deterministic safety and necessary intelligence is not yet cleanly resolved.**

### 3. Bounded Measurable Claim, Not Perfect Security

Agent Hypervisor does not claim to make agents perfectly secure. It claims to make a defined set of safety properties *deterministically enforceable and measurably testable*.

The correct claim: **for every physics law defined in the World Policy, conformance is binary, testable, and reproducible.** This is a strictly weaker statement than "the agent is safe," but a strictly stronger statement than "we hope the guardrail catches it."

We trade the illusion of complete safety for a smaller set of properties with actual guarantees.

---

## Open Questions

1. **Where does the semantic boundary belong?** How much intelligence can exist at Layer 2's input processing before it becomes a probabilistic guardrail? Can we define a formal interface between "deterministic core" and "intelligent adapter"?

2. **Can taint propagation scale?** In a real agent with dozens of tools and complex data flows, does taint tracking remain practical without unacceptable performance or usability costs?

3. **Multi-agent composition.** When multiple agents share a universe, how do their World Policies compose? Can we define compositional safety properties?

4. **Real-world integration.** How does the hypervisor integrate with existing agent frameworks without requiring complete rewrites? What is the minimum viable boundary?

5. **Measurable security metrics.** Can we define a quantitative metric for "how much of the attack surface is covered by deterministic physics" vs. left to probabilistic components?

6. **Reversibility in practice.** External effects (sent emails, API calls, database writes) are often irreversible. How far can the reversibility model extend in real deployments?

---

## 8. Architectural Invariants

A system conforms to the Agent Hypervisor model if and only if all of the following invariants hold:

**I-1. Input Invariant.**
No external signal reaches the agent without passing through the virtualization boundary. Raw text, raw tool output, and raw memory reads do not exist in the agent's interface.

**I-2. Provenance Invariant.**
Every object in the agent's world has a provenance record initialized at Layer 2 (Semantic Event construction) and maintained through all transformations. Provenance cannot be removed or forged by the agent.

**I-3. Taint Invariant.**
Any object derived from an untrusted source carries a taint marker. Taint propagates through all operations. A tainted object cannot cross the external execution boundary without explicit sanitization at Layer 3.

**I-4. Determinism Invariant.**
Layer 3 (Execution Governance) contains no probabilistic components. Given identical inputs, it always produces identical outputs. It is unit-testable without mocking.

**I-5. Separation Invariant.**
The agent has no direct access to Layers 0, 1, or 3. The agent can only receive Semantic Events (from Layer 2) and emit Intent Proposals (to Layer 3). All other interactions are mediated by the hypervisor.

**I-6. Reversibility Invariant.**
Actions classified as irreversible by the World Policy cannot reach external execution without explicit approval. The classification is performed at Layer 3, not inferred by the agent.

**I-7. Budget Invariant.**
Resource budgets (token count, action count, scope, time) are enforced at Layer 3. Budget exhaustion results in hard termination, not soft degradation.

**Conformance test pattern:**

```text
untrusted_input → semantic_event → agent_intent → policy_eval → denied
tainted_object  → agent_intent  → policy_eval  → export_blocked
trusted_input   → semantic_event → agent_intent → policy_eval → allowed
```

If these three cases are unit-testable without mocking the agent, the system is conformant.

## 9. Relationship to 12-Factor Agent

Agent Hypervisor is an architectural mechanism.
12-Factor Agent is an evaluation standard.

The 12 factors describe properties a conformant agentic system must exhibit. Agent Hypervisor describes one way to construct a system that exhibits those properties.

| 12-Factor Agent                      | Agent Hypervisor                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Virtualized Reality (Factor 1)       | Layer 0 + Layer 2                     |
| Structured Input (Factor 2)          | Semantic Event construction (Layer 2) |
| Provenance as Type (Factor 3)        | Provenance Invariant (I-2)            |
| Taint by Default (Factor 4)          | Taint Invariant (I-3)                 |
| Intent, Not Execution (Factor 5)     | Intent Proposal layer                 |
| Deterministic Policy (Factor 6)      | Layer 3 + Determinism Invariant (I-4) |
| Minimal Universe (Factor 7)          | Base Ontology (Layer 1)               |
| Segmented Memory (Factor 8)          | Provenance + trust-zone model         |
| Reversibility by Default (Factor 9)  | Reversibility Invariant (I-6)         |
| Bounded Autonomy (Factor 10)         | Separation Invariant (I-5)            |
| Testable Physics (Factor 11)         | Conformance test pattern              |
| Containment Independence (Factor 12) | Layer independence model              |

A system can conform to the 12-Factor standard without using Agent Hypervisor as its implementation mechanism. Agent Hypervisor is a reference architecture, not the only valid one.
