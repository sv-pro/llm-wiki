## M1 Foundation

### [x] README v2 — #1 (CLOSED)

**Labels:** docs, architecture, high-priority

**Goal:** Create a one-page overview explaining the raw reality problem, the shift from permission security to ontological security, and the core `Reality -> Hypervisor -> Agent` model.

**Tasks:**

- Explain why agents are unsafe in unvirtualized reality.
- Add the canonical formula: "We do not make agents safe. We make the world they live in safe."
- Add a short "What works today" section: prompt injection containment, taint containment, provenance tracking, deterministic intent handling.
- Add quickstart and link to `WHITEPAPER.md`.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- A new reader understands in under 10 minutes that the hypervisor virtualizes perception and action rather than filtering behavior.
- README terminology matches the whitepaper and core docs.

---

### [x] CONCEPT.md v2 — #2 (CLOSED)

**Labels:** docs, architecture, high-priority

**Goal:** Write a short serious explainer for people who should understand the idea without reading the full whitepaper.

**Tasks:**

- Summarize the problem, hypervisor analogy, semantic isolation, and ontological security.
- Include the honest weakness: semantic gap.
- State the bounded measurable security claim instead of perfect security.
- Separate architecture thesis, current PoC status, and open questions.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- The doc can be shared standalone as the shortest credible explanation of the project.
- It clearly distinguishes what is already demonstrated from what is still a research claim.

---

### [ ] WHITEPAPER freeze v2 — #3 (OPEN)

**Labels:** docs, architecture, high-priority

**Goal:** Freeze one canonical whitepaper that acts as the source of truth for code, demo, and narrative.

**Tasks:**

- Unify terminology across core architecture, semantic gap, AI Aikido, World Manifest Compiler, design-time HITL, and MCP virtualization.
- Make the narrative flow explicit: claim -> objection -> resolution -> formalization -> bounded claim.
- Remove terminology drift and duplicated definitions.
- Ensure MVP section maps to implementation tasks.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- The same term does not change meaning between sections.
- The whitepaper can serve as the canonical reference for repo docs, implementation, and public articles.

---

### [ ] THREAT_MODEL.md — #4 (OPEN)

**Labels:** docs, architecture, high-priority

**Goal:** Define the threat model and trust assumptions explicitly.

**Tasks:**

- Define trusted boundary and untrusted inputs.

- List out-of-scope items and explicit constraints.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- A reader can point to the exact virtualization boundary and trust assumptions.
- Non-goals are as explicit as goals.

---

### [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md — #5 (OPEN)

**Labels:** docs, architecture

**Goal:** Provide a concise implementation-oriented architecture document.

**Tasks:**

- Document the runtime path: raw input -> semantic event -> trust assignment -> taint propagation -> capability lookup -> intent proposal -> policy decision -> audit trace.
- Document the compilation path: human intent + LLM semantic modeling -> World Manifest -> deterministic runtime artifacts.
- Add one reference diagram for runtime and compile flow.
- Map document sections to planned modules: compiler, runtime, gateway, demo.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Someone can understand the reference architecture without reading the full whitepaper.
- The architecture doc maps directly to code modules.
